title: "Oceanside RV Resort - Charleston, OR"
description: "Oceanside Resort is located on the beach, just south of the small port town of Charleston. Our work involved designing and painting a welcoming mural at the resortâ€™s main entrance, creating a series of theme signs for beach cottages and general store, along with a logo design and building signage for the Coos Bay Crab Company. The subject matter in the artwork reflects the surrounding landscape, local industries and points of interest of the area."
