title: "Peninsular Bighorn"
location: Borrego Springs, CA
description: "This mural was painted as a part of our Palm Canyon Resort project. We selected the bighorn to bring attention to the small endangered herds that are located in the Anza Borrego Desert State Park. The beautiful animals are such a symbolic part of the landscape that it would be a great loss were they to die out due to human encroachment on their territory."
