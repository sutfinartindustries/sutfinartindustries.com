title: "Shattered Mirror Mosaic - Montecito, CA"
description: "This art project was privately commissioned for a home in Montecito, California. The mosaicâ€™s were created using thousands of pieces of shattered mirror, set in a dark charcoal grout and protected with patinated steel frames. The hand set pieces of mirror are tilted slightly to cause the refraction of light upon their surroundings."
