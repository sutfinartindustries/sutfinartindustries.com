location: Borrego Springs, CA
description: "The composition of this mural is specific to its location. We wanted the look of an old time vaudeville poster with the primary color being the one on the building. We were also wanting to incorporate the old style rain gutter spouts into the image as borders for a transition of color between the two buildings."
