title: "Shattered Mirror Mosaics"
description: "These mosaics were commissioned for a private home in Montecito, CA. The pair of mosaics were created using thousands of pieces of shattered mirror, set in a dark charcoal grout and framed with patinated steel. The hand set pieces of mirror are tilted slightly to cause the refraction of light to spill out upon their surroundings."
